# smiley.net's coding style guide
An opinionated (mostly) documentation repository on coding styles and conventions I follow in my projects.

## Major Conventions
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) - Provides clear standards for informative commit messages, enforced via commitlint (see below)

[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) - Machine generated commitlogs are useful for developers, but are not user centric. A manual CHANGELOG.md is kept to write user oriented descriptions of major changes, and the machine generated log for commits is instead named COMMITLOG.md.

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) - "Versioning without sentimentality", a system that gives clear meaning to version changes.
